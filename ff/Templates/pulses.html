<h1>About Pulses</h1>
<p class="para">
Pulses are annual crops that yield between one and 12 grains or seeds. The term “pulses” is limited to crops harvested solely as dry grains, which differentiates them from other vegetable crops that are harvested while still green.Between 2010 and 2013, 173 different countries grew and exported pulses.Pulses are healthy, nutritious and easy to cook with. Growing pulses also promotes sustainable agriculture, as pulse crops help decrease greenhouse gases, increase soil health,and use less water than other crops.</p>
<h2>India Important Pulses Growing Zones</h2>
<p class="para">
Pulses in India have long been considered as the poor man’s only source of protein. Pulses are grown on 22-23 million hectares of area with an annual production of 13-15 million tonnes (mt). India accounts for 33% of the world area and 22% of the world produc­tion of pulses.The most important states of pulses production are Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, which together accounts for 82 % of the production from 74% area.The most important pulse crop in the country is chickpea which accounts for 47% of total pulse production from 33% of total pulse area. Six states (Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana,Maharashtra and Karnataka) together contribute 90% of total chickpea production.
The second most important pulse is pigeonpea with most of the area concentrating in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The urdbean and mungbean are largely concentrating in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.</p>
<h2>Climate requirement</h2>
<p class="para">
Pulses crops are developed in Kharif, Rabi, and Zaid during periods of the Agricultural year. Rabi crops require a gentle cold environment during the planting period, during vegetative to pod improvement cold environment, and during development/reaping warm environment.Likewise, Kharif pulses crops require a warm environment for the duration of their life from planting to gathering. Summer pulses crops are habitants of a warm environment.Seed is needed to pass numerous stages to produce final crop like germination, seedling, vegetative, blooming, natural product setting, advanced grain development, and harvesting.</p>
<h2>Soil</h2>
<p class="para">
Pulse crops must have phosphorus for plant development, nodule formation, and nitrogen fixation. A soil test will provide a guideline for phosphorus requirements. Pulses are sensitive to seed-placed phosphate (P 2 O 5) fertilizer. Sensitivity is greater for pea, followed by chickpea, lentil, dry bean, and faba bean.</p>
<h2>Fertilizer Management</h2>
<p class="para">
Pulses are next to cereals in terms of their economic and nutritional importance as human food. Nutrient imbalance is one of the major abiotic constraints limiting productivity of pulses. The inbuilt unique mechanism of biological N2 fixation enables pulse crops to meet 80-90% of their N requirements, hence a small dose of 15-25 kg N/ha as starter dose is sufficient to meet out the requirement of most of the pulse crops. Phosphorus and sulphur requirement of pulses are higher than cereals due to their role in root proliferation, nodulation and protein synthesis. Enhanced use of chemical fertilizers has created imbalance to the soil nutrients supply system resulting in lower productivity of pulses.</p>
<h2>Nutrient Management</h2>
<p class="para">
Nutrient imbalance is one of the major abiotic constraints limiting productivity of pulses. The inbuilt mechanism of biological N2 fixation enable pulse crops to meet 80–90 per cent of their nitrogen requirements, hence a small dose of 15–25 kg N/ha is sufficient to meet out the requirement of most of the pulse crops.</p>
