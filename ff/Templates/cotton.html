<h1><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>About Cotton<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class="para">Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple <span class=SpellE>fiber</span>
that grows in a boll, or protective case, around the seeds of the cotton plants
of the genus Gossypium in the mallow family <span class=SpellE>Malvaceae</span>.
The <span class=SpellE>fiber</span> is almost pure cellulose, and can contain
minor percentages of waxes, fats, <span class=SpellE>pectins</span>, and water.
Under natural conditions, the cotton bolls will increase the dispersal of the
seeds.</p>

<p class="para">The plant is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions
around the world, including the Americas, Africa, Egypt and India. The greatest
diversity of wild cotton species is found in Mexico, followed by Australia and <span
class=SpellE>Africa.Cotton</span> was independently domesticated in the Old and
New Worlds.</p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>History of Cotton<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="para">The earliest evidence of the use of cotton in the Old World,
dated to 5500 BC and preserved in copper beads, has been found at the Neolithic
site of <span class=SpellE>Mehrgarh</span>, at the foot of the Bolan Pass in
ancient India, today in <span class=SpellE>Balochistan</span> Pakistan.
Fragments of cotton textiles have been found at <span class=SpellE>Mohenjo-daro</span>
and other sites of the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization, and cotton may
have been an important export from it.</p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soil<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="para">Cotton is grown on a variety of soils across the world. Deep,
fertile soil with adequate humus and high water holding capacity and good
internal drainage is best suited for growing <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>cotton.Cotton</span></span> is sensitive to excessive moisture and
water <span class=SpellE>logging.Under</span> rainfed conditions, it is
generally grown on soils with high water holding capacity provide better internal
drainage and greater productivity. Where irrigation is available it is
cultivated on a variety of soils ranging from <span class=GramE>sandy to sandy</span>
loam and clay looms. Cotton being a deep-rooted crop, soil depth of less than
60 cm is considered unfavourable. Cotton grows best on neutral to slightly
alkaline soils and a pH of 7.0 to 8.0 is considered optimum. The minimum pH for
successful cotton cultivation is 5.3. Cotton is sensitive to salinity only
during germination and early crop establishment</p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Climatic
Requirement<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="para">Cotton can be grown in places wherever, at least 180-200 frost
free days are <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>available.Optimum</span></span>
temperature for germination 20-300C. Germination will be delayed if the
temperature is <span class=SpellE>lessthan</span> 180C.</p>

<p class="para">For vegetative growth, mean daily temperature of 21-27oC is
optimum. Day temperatures ranging from 27-32oC with cool nights favour fruiting
&amp; boll development. The growth of cotton plant and fibre development is
seriously limited when the minimum temperature falls below 15oC. Optimum
temperature for peak flowering ranges from 29-34oC. Under adequate soil
moisture, cotton withstand high temperatures of 43-45oC for short periods.</p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nutrition
Management<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="para">Soil in cotton growing areas have a low organic matter content
ranged from 0.5 to 1.25 per cent, albeit cotton sheds residues like burs,
leaves, flowers, etc., It responds to organic matter addition and green
manuring in tropical <span class=SpellE>India.Cultivar</span> MCU-5 yielding
3.2 t/ha seed cotton removes 190 kg N, 61 kg P2O5 and 195 kg K2O per ha, the
uptake of N, P, K, Ca &amp; Mg was highest when leaf water potentials are
maintained at - 0.8 to 1.0 Pa.</p>

<h2><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Types <o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="para">Hybrid varieties are also cultivated. The two New World cotton
species account for the vast majority of modern cotton production, but the two
Old World species were widely used before the 1900s. While cotton <span
class=SpellE>fibers</span> occur naturally in <span class=SpellE>colors</span>
of white, brown, pink and green, fears of contaminating the genetics of white
cotton have led many cotton-growing locations to ban the growing of <span
class=SpellE>colored</span> cotton varieties</p>

<p class="para">In India, cotton is mainly cultivated in the states of
Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh. It is grown in
black clayey soil with a warm climate. When its plant starts flowering, they
give flowers of yellowish-white colour which turns red after a few days.
