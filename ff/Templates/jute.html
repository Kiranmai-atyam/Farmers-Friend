<h1>About Jute</h1>
<p class="para">
Jute is an important natural fibre crop in India next to cotton. In trade and industry, jute and mesta crop together known as raw jute as their uses are almost same. Raw jute plays an important role in the country’s economy. Raw jute was originally considered as a source of raw material for packaging industries only. But it has now emerged as a versatile raw material for diverse applications, such as, textile industries, paper industries, building and automotive industries, use as soil saver, use as decorative and furnishing materials, etc. Raw jute being bio-degradable and annually renewable source, it is considered as an environment-friendly crop and it helps in the maintenance of the environment and ecological balance. Further attraction of Jute lies in its easy availability, inexhaustible quantity at a comparatively cheaper rate. Moreover, it can easily be blended with other natural and manmade fibres.</p>

<p class="para">

With its insignificant coverage of total cultivated area, it plays a predominant role in the country’s economy by generating employment, earning foreign exchange, solving many of the socio-economic problems, etc. In earlier years, Jute was considered as a Golden Fibre but there after it had to pass through different critical situation. The main problem came in the way with the introduction of synthetic fibre by the end of sixties/early seventies. After the development of diversified product of jute fibre and due to growing concern about the environment pollution, the importance of jute has again revived.</p> 
  
<h2>History of Jute</h2>

<p class="para">
For centuries, jute has been an integral part of the culture of East Bengal and some parts of West Bengal, precisely in the southwest of Bangladesh. Since the seventeenth century, the British started trading in jute. During the reign of the British Empire jute was also used in the military. British jute barons grew rich processing jute and selling manufactured products made from jute. Dundee Jute Barons and the British East India Company set up many jute mills in Bengal and by 1895 jute industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish jute trade. Many Scots emigrated to Bengal to set up jute factories. More than a billion jute sandbags were exported from Bengal to the trenches during World War I and also exported to the southern United States region to bag cotton. It was used in the fishing, construction, art and the arms industry. Initially, due to its texture, it could only be processed by hand until it was discovered in Dundee that by treating it with whale oil, it could be treated by machine.</p>

<h2>Climate requirement</h2>

<p class="para">
Jute cultivation is mainly concentrated in the eastern and north eastern India while that of mesta cultivation is spread almost throughout the country. The crop can be grown in low, medium and high land situation, both moisture stress and water stagnating condition. White Jute can be grown comparatively in low land situation while that of Tossa Jute prefers medium and high land situation. Mesta is grown in almost all over the country. It being a hardy crop and can tolerate moisture stress; its cultivation is spread in different agro-climatic situations unlike jute which is concentrated only in eastern and north eastern States. In a major part of Jute area, particularly in North Bengal, Bihar and North-Eastern States, the soil is acidic in nature. However, the Jute crop is growing in these areas in existing situation adjusting the crop sequence.</p>

<h2>Crop production Practices </h2>

<p class="para">
Time of sowing:</p>             
<ul class="para">
<li>Sowing time of jute may differ from area to area on the basis of the receipt of pre-monsoon showers, availability of residual moisture and variety. Generally,sowing in middle of March is optimum for all varities.</li>
</ul>  

<p class="para">
Methods of sowing:
</p>             
<ul class="para">
<li>Sowing of jute can be done either by broadcast method or by line sowing method.Line sowing can be undertaken with the help of seed drill. Line sowing has got certain advantages over broadcasting method such as i) Plant growth is uniform since uniform spacing is maintained, ii) Intercultural operation like weeding, hoeing, etc. become easier andcheaper. iii)Application of pesticides and top dressing of fertilizer is easier, iv) Yield is higher by about 15-20% v) Requirement of seed is less etc.
</li>
</ul>  

<p class="para">
Land preparation:</p>             
<ul class="para">
<li>Jute seeds being small require very fine tilth. The land can be prepared by ploughing and cross-harrowing 3-5 times followed by planking. In acidic soils (pH <6.0), incorporation of 1-1.5t/ha of lime, 30-40days before sowing is necessary for better crop performance. Soil moisture between 21-45% is considered ideal for proper germination. </li>
</ul>  

<p class="para">
Fertilizer management:</p>             
<ul class="para">
<li>In general, the nutrient requirement of capsularis is more than that of olitorius. In soils with low organic carbon content, FYM application @ 5-10t/ha, amonth prior to crop sowing is recommended. The leaf fall from the standing crop and also root stubbles left in the soil after harvest results in recycling of hand some amount of nutrients besides organic matter in intensive cropping systems. The recommended doses of fertilizers are 40 to 80, 20 to 40, 20 to 40 kg/ha (olitorius) and 60 to 80, 30 to 40, 30 to 40 kg/ha (capsularis) of N:P:K respectively</li>
</ul>  

<p class="para">
Water management:</p>             
<ul class="para">
<li>Jute requires about 50 cm water for its growth and development. In India about 15% jute area is irrigated and the remaining area is rainfed. If the rainfall is not sufficient, the water requirement has to be supplemented through irrigation. For germination of jute seed, about 18-20% soil moisture is required. At sowing time, if the soil moisture is not sufficient, then one pre-sowing irrigation is to be given. After sowing, usually one or two irrigations at an interval of about 20 days is required at the initial stages of growth. Jute is sensitive to both drought and water logging. At germination and knee-high stages, adequate soil moisture must be ensured by irrigation. During rainy season, the crop experiences water logging that adversely affects fibre quality. Provision of quick drainage in uplands will be beneficial to the crop. However, in lowlands, it may not be feasible.</li>
