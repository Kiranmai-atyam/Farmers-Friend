<h1>About Millets</h1>
<p class="para">
Millets are a highly varied group of small-seeded grasses, widely grown around the world as cereal crops or grains for fodder and human food. Most species generally referred to as millets belong to the tribe Paniceae, but some millets also belong to various other taxa.millets are important crops in the semiarid tropics of Asia and Africa especially in India, Mali, Nigeria, and Niger, with 97% of millet production in developing countries.This crop is favored due to its productivity and short growing season under dry, high-temperature conditions.
millets are indigenous to many parts of the world. The most widely grown millets are sorghum and pearl millets, which are important crops in India and parts of Africa. Finger millet, proso millet, and foxtail millet are also important crop species.millets may have been consumed by humans for about 7,000 years and potentially had "a pivotal role in the rise of multi-crop agriculture and settled farming societies.</p>
<h2>India Important Millets Growing Zones</h2>
<p class="para">
Millets are cultivated in low-fertile land, tribal and rain-fed and mountainous areas.It is grown for hay in North America and western Europe, and it is an important food crop in China and other Asian countries. Finger millet (Eleusine coracana) is an important food grain in southern Asia and parts of Africa.One way to consider this is brown Top millet is also grown and consumed in limited quantities in north-central India. The scientific name of the crop is Urochloa ramose and the common name is Dixie signal grass. Along with India, the United States, Africa, western Asia, Arabia, China, and Australia also harvest this crop.

<h2>Climate requirement</h2>
<p class="para">
Different climatic conditions are required for different types of millets, however, the climatic condition outline remains roughly the same for all:
A warm, temperate climate is essential for the sprouting and germination of the millet seeds to keep the soil temperature cozy since they are susceptible to damage by cold weather and frosts\
The sustainable temperature for millet growth is 20-30 degrees Celsius.
Most millets have a short growing season and can be grown well in areas where other crops fail to grow.
Most millets can do with little moisture since they have efficient water utilization abilities.
In India about 8 millet types are cultivated under rain-fed conditions which require little or no irrigation, as they do not require high amounts of moisture -. For example, Jowar is a rain-fed crop (30-100cm, annually ) grown in the areas which barely need irrigation.
Usually, minor millets require below 35cm of rainfall, while a few other major millets require at least 40cm of rainfall for a good harvest.
Most millets such as Jowar, Ragi, Bajra, Sorghum, etc. are grown as Kharif crops i.e. as monsoon or autumn crops cultivated between June to November, as their moisture and rainfall requirements are such.</p>
<h2>Soil</h2>
<p class="para">
The usual soil type in which millets grow in include well-drained, loamy soils with balanced moisture content. Millets are the staple food in the regions of Manipur, Meghalaya, and Nagaland, due to which their production is being encouraged there.</p>
<h2>Fertilizer Management</h2>
<p class="para">
Application of nitrogen in the soils with low available nitrogen is beneficial for enhancing productivity. Nitrogen in combination with phosphorus or recommended dose of balanced fertilizer can boost the yield of millet. For sustainable production of millet, integrated nutrient management can be adopted.

<h2>Nutrient Management</h2>
<p class="para">
Millets are important source of food and livelihood in arid and semi-arid ecologies and covers a significant area in these regions due to their strong abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, particularly their capacity to withstand dry conditions. Since, the grains of these crops have better nutritional qualities compared to other cereals, therefore, to ensure nutritional security in the vulnerable regions, millets can be good option to be included as staple food. The continuous application of high analysis chemical fertilizers without organic manures resulted in reduced water holding capacity, emergence of multi-nutrient deficiencies and consequently lower crop yields. Thus, for long-term ecological and economic sustainability in rainfed millet systems, there is a need to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient buffering capacity of soil by integrated nutrient management through increasing the use of organic sources such as farmyard manures (FYM), biocompost, biofertilizers and legumes inclusion in cropping systems. Efficient nutrient management approaches are among key strategies to realize higher yields in rainfed regions.
